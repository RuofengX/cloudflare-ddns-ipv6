# Cloudflare DDNS IPv6

## How to use

This program uses environment to config user's bearer token, zone and domain record.

There three config environment variables:

* CF_BEARER_KEY  
  The API key. You should get one on cloudflare web dashboard.
* CF_ZONE  
  The name of cloudflare's zone. Default is your root domain.
  For example "yourhomelab.com"
* CF_DOMAIN  
  The final domain that your want change.
  For example "nas.yourhomelab.com"

The program will use system call to search every net interfaces on the system,
and then detect every IPv6 address of each interface.  
It would yield first public IPv6 address (stop the search) and
use the environment variables call the cloudflare api to set that record.
